## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [WebPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) - Bundle the Files...
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For Every Logic Purpose we use TS.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - CSS for styles.
- [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en) - Node js
